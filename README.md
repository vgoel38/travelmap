TravelMap is a web application which lists all the places I have ever been to, on the Google Map. Click on
a place marker to see the latest Wikipedia articles about that place.

You can also enter a location name in the text box in the slider menu on the left to filter among the places. Click on a location name to see where it is located on the map.

APIs Used:
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
