# travelmap
TravelMap is a web application which lists all the places I have ever travelled to on the Google Map. Clicking on
a location animates the marker and displays the latest Wikipedia articles about that location.

User can enter a location name in the text box on the left to filter among the locations. User can also click on a
location in the list to animate the marker and read the information about the location.
